# Prodigy-Path-Server

## Problem Domain

This project is a mentorship application designed to connect individuals who want to learn new skills or gain experience in a particular field with individuals who are experienced and willing to share their knowledge and skills. The application allows users to sign up as either a mentor or a mentee, and then search for potential partners based on various tags, such as the specific skills or industry they are interested in. Once a mentor and mentee have connected, they can communicate through the application and share contact information such as phone numbers, email addresses, and social media handles.

## Problem Solved

The main problem this application solves is the difficulty that many individuals face when entering a new industry or trying to learn new skills. By providing a platform for mentors and mentees to connect, this application makes it easier for new individuals to gain insight into an industry and make valuable connections. Additionally, mentors can also benefit from the application by staying current in their field and gaining mentorship experience.

## MVP

The MVP of this application is a working platform that allows users to sign up as either a mentor or mentee, search for potential partners, and connect with each other through the application. This would include a search function with filtering capabilities, a messaging feature, and the ability for mentors to approve mentee requests and share contact information.
